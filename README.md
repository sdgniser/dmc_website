# DMC Website

Repository for the website of Drama &amp; Music Club

<h2>Unsolved issues:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
  The site needs content:
    <ul>
    <li>Introductory Text</li>
    <li>Pictures of events</li>
    <li>Details of events</li>
    <li>Details of members</li>
    <li>Contact Info</li>
    <li>Details about SPIC-MACAY</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    The scrolling action in Events Section needs improvements, such as: a shadow effect or perhaps arrows, to make the user aware of the existence of a scrollable area. Also, the spacing of the two side-by-side divs, as well as, the timeline needs to be more adaptive to neighbouring content.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    A way to pull event-images from a web source (GDrive...), would cut the site loading time, by quite a bit.
  </li>
  <br>
 </ol>
