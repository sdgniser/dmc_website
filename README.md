## To do:
1. Formatting "Contact Us"
2. Media Rules

3. The site needs content:
* <del>Introductory Text</del>
* Pictures of events
* Details of events
* <del>Details of members</del>
* Contact Info
* Details about SPIC-MACAY

4. <del>A way to pull event-images from a web source (GDrive...), would cut the site loading time, by quite a bit. - Implemented for "member-images" | Follows the process, discussed <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/drive/yU_yF9SI_z0/discussion">here</a>. | ISSUES: The process is manual and must be repeated for each image.</del> â¬… This is impractical. Stick to links to GDrive Folders.

## More stuff to code for:
1. A blog.
2. Prefixes and browser fallbacks.
3. Media Rules for responsiveness.

## Final Touches
* Color Palette
* Semantic HTML
* Smaller optimisations before putting up the website on the domain.
