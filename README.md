# DMC Website - Testing Ground

This repo is for trying out any kinds of alterations to the webpage. Expect a lot of things to be broken.

## To do:
1. Extending tile backgrond to nav
2. Fixing the sidebar
3. Finalising and maybe recoding the preloader
4. Media Rules
5. Accordion style list visual changes
6. Addition of a contact us form
7. Fixing the broken social links in members
8. Fixing the stutter in the social link of the club
9. Finalising gallery code.

  The site needs content:
    <ul>
      <li><del>Introductory Text</del></li>
    <li>Pictures of events</li>
    <li>Details of events</li>
      <li><del>Details of members</del></li>
    <li>Contact Info</li>
    <li>Details about SPIC-MACAY</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    The scrolling action on the page and in sections, like .timeline in #events needs improvements. It can be janky, sometimes, at the moment.

    <del>A way to pull event-images from a web source (GDrive...), would cut the site loading time, by quite a bit. - Implemented for "member-images" | Follows the process, discussed <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/drive/yU_yF9SI_z0/discussion">here</a>. | ISSUES: The process is manual and must be repeated for each image.</del> â¬… This is impractical. Stick to links to GDrive Folders.
